These are the modules created by the Katsu/Ketsu/Zetsu community.

## What is Ketsu ?
Ketsu is a modular application, which means that you can create your own modules and use them inside the app. You can use it to watch videos, read differents types of text and images. You can find the ipa file here [Ketsu](https://ketsu.app/).

## How can I download Ketsu since it's not available in the App Store anymore ?
You can still sideload it on your phone for free with softwares like AltStore or Sideloadly. You will find tutorials made by the creator in English here and one in French made by me here.
